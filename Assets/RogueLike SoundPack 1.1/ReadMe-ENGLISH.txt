/Atmosphere/
Contains a few ambient sounds. Use them to create creepy
background moody sounds for your player. Mostly made of very low synthetic
sounds and a some acoustic stuff slowed down.

/Environment/
This file contains various sounds to illustrate interactions with decor, such
as door, traps, walls moving, triggers, and "magic shrines", typically used in Roguelikes
mechanics.

/Footsteps/
I created various footsteps sounds for various types of floor (dirt, stone, wood). You can
add the "ArmorOnStep" sounds above the regular footstep sound if the character has an armor.
This folder also contains giant monster step sounds.

/Impact/
This very important folder concerns combat sounds. I tried to make useful and precise sounds here. 
Sounds there are always named as the material that hits another, like MetalOnFlesh or 
MetalOnArmor. You will also find the shield blocking sounds, the arrow hitting various targets,
and a critical hit sound I made if you wish to use crit strikes or similar mechanic.

/Interface/
I composed four small medieval style jingles that you can use for events, and made
two different styles of cursor. One in an acoustic style and the other digital/retro
style.

/Items/
I tried to guess what you could plan to implement in your game, so I did random items
sounds here, like potions, a map, a torch, and so on.
All the sounds starting by "pick" illustrates the player looting them, but you can
also use those when the player manipulates it in his inventory, for instance.

/Magic/
A few classic sounds I made on regular magic themes such as healing, elements... Usually,
they are two types for each, "Cast" to illustrate the use of magic and "Hit" if, for
instance, a projectile of this magic's type hits a target.

/Monsters/
This folder contains several monster sound. I did classic style monsters such as zombies
and slimes.

/Movement/
This folder is pretty important. It contains many movement sounds such as Jumping, Landing,
and bodies falling. Each version exists with an armor weared.

/Weapons/
The weapon folder contains various weapons sounds, such as a sword or an axe. For each
weapon, there is an "equip" and "unequip" sounds, swings sounds and other stuff for
special weapons.

----3.Notes ----------

-I strongly advice  you to implement all the variations I provided for each sound in your game,
and if possible, to add a pitch and level randomiser to avoid player's ears exhaust.
Certain sounds such as footsteps have a much lower volume. I did it to prevent
annoying and repetitive sounds.
-I am planning to make free content updapte. Stay tuned!
